 Hello, my name is Jungyoub (Jayden) Cha. I am currently an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at **KAIST**, and an intern at **NAVER Corp, Media Intelligence**. I previously worked as a radio broadcaster at **American Forces Network** of the US Army, fulfilling mandatory millitary service as a KATUSA (Korean Augmentation to the US Army). 

My research interests mainly lie in **Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence** and especially **Natural Language Processing**.

Recently, I have particularly gained interest in how **language models** can be devised to utilize prior knowledge and common sense more effectively, and **extracting information** from user-generated data.
