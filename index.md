Greetings, my name is Jungyoub Cha. I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing Electrical Engineering at the **Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)**. 

Previously, I've worked as a research intern at the **DAVIAN Lab**, where I was privileged to work under the guidance of **Professor Jaegul Choo**. I also had the opportunity to intern at the Media Intelligence department of **NAVER Corp**. I served my mandatory military service as a radio broadcaster for the **American Forces Network**, contributing as a KATUSA (Korean Augmentation to the US Army).

My research interests mainly lie in **Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.**
