Greetings, my name is Jungyoub Cha. I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing Electrical Engineering at the **Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)**. Concurrently, I am serving as a research intern at the **DAVIAN Lab**, where I am privileged to work under the esteemed guidance of **Professor Jaegul Choo**.

Prior to this, I had the opportunity to intern at the Media Intelligence department of **NAVER Corp**. I also worked as a radio broadcaster for the **American Forces Network**, serving my mandatory military service as a KATUSA (Korean Augmentation to the US Army).

My research interests mainly lie in **Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Speech Recognition.**
